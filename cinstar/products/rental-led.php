                    Rental led display literally means the LED display for rental market. It is also called led display rental or led display for hire. Literally speaking, it should include all the LED displays which are rentable such as permanent installation LED billboard display for advertising, mobile LED display trailer for live broadcasting and even perimeter banner LED video display etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the definition of rental LED display from manufacturers is slight different. It is opposite to the fixed installation led display and is narrowed to refer to such LED display with very light weight, slim and sleek panel, support fast set up and dismantle and could be removable. For instance, the led display for concert, mobile stage background and music festival where the LED display just be there for a few days or a certain period, then it will be taken down and transported to other location for new events.

                Defined by its application environment, rental LED display is divided into indoor rental LED display and outdoor rental LED display. Normally, for the same series rental LED display, both indoor and outdoor models share the same panel design and could be installed in one screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Indoor rental LED display</b> is usually used to indoor events like exhibition, award ceremony, fashion show, car show, wedding and conference room etc where require no waterproof on the LED display and no need high brightness. But the led display has to be qualified to deliver <a href="../">high definition image quality</a> and superb visual performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                For these indoor events, the market trend goes to lower and lower pixel pitch. It went to 3.9mm years ago, but now is 2.9mm or 2.6mm even lower pitch. The main reason is that the clients are always expecting better and clearer image to their spectators. If your rental LED display is with lower pixel pitch than others, then you will be much competitive on the market. It is the nature of market and competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                <b>Outdoor rental LED display</b> is widely used to outdoor events like sport venue, touring, concert, music festival etc where require the LED display has to be waterproof (IP65 or IP54) and high brightness (more than 5000nits). Considering the viewing distance, such outdoor events are not very picked on the pixel pitch but pays more attention to its durability and stability. The demand of current market is 3.9mm and 4.8mm, but it will go to lower pixel pitch in the near future for sure.

                As a mainstream video equipment, rental LED display is tailored to meet multiple installations varying with specific event. Here are the most common installations rental LED display mostly applied to.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>

                        <p>
                        For the events which require LED display up in the air, the suspension installation will be adopted. If there are existing suspension points on the site, it would be perfect. Just connect suspension points and rental LED display panels with suspension brackets. Otherwise, a truss will be needed to support the whole LED video display.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For the suspension installation, it is crucial to do an elaborate and accurate calculation on the weight capacity of rigging and suspension bracket (factory should declare the weight capacity of their panel and bracket) before starting any set up. Safety first, a carelessness might lead to a disaster.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                        If the LED display has to be installed against the wall, then it will be wall mounted installation which is the most common installation of LED display. For such installation, you will be in need of a structure frame mounted to the wall, then connect the LED display panel to the frame with connecting plates. 
Keep in mind that the total weight of LED screen display and structure frame has to be within weight capacity of the wall. Such calculation has to be done at the initial stage of the project.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        As to the events which set no possibility for rigging or suspension, it comes to the ground stacking. For such installation, normally factory will supply the stacking system compatible to their LED display.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        When installing the stacking system, it is necessary to make sure the stacking frame is placed on the even ground. Otherwise, some gaps may appear on the LED display and affect the image quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        And remember that when you build a <a href="../">giant LED video display</a> with ground stacking system, it has to be with enough weight load to prevent the LED video display falling forward.

                        Video processor is a key equipment for rental events. At first, it should convert other input signals into the ones LED display accepts. For example, a live broadcasting from camera. Besides, the video processor can easier your content management and create more eye-catching effects on the LED display.

                        <p>
                        For instance, a giant LED display with more than 10million pixels, except the NovaStar controllers (each controller can only load part of the display), a splicing video processor is needed to configure it to be a complete LED video display.

If you don’t have power distribution units, power cable layout will be a big trouble. But things are different with power distribution units even if there are very limited power interfaces available on site.

                <p>
                No matter you are investing a LED display for one specific event or for your growing business, you need to make a prediction on your business scale. For instance, if you are asked to supply 50sqm rental LED display for one event and you will still use it after that. Then how many square meters you will purchase?
                </p>
                <p>
                Before answering this question, you should be aware of one fact about LED display, it is the batch problem. If you buy a LED display now and months later you want to buy more to match your current LED display for bigger events, then you will find out that they can’t be used in one screen. Because they are from two batches LEDs which with different color and brightness. Such situation happens quite often.
                </p>
                <p>
                Comes back to that question, you will now have more practical answer after looking back your past events and making a prediction about your business scale in the near future.
